    <h3>What?</h3>

    The country is divided, and one way to understand that division is a split between city dwellers and low-density areas. This visualization shows the relationship between population density and propensity to vote Democratic.

    <h3>Why?</h3>

Because we are in the midst of a political disaster and doing small hacks is my way of coping. The first time Trump won, I went to hackathon and cobbled together a somewhat politically-relevant Alexa skill, <a href="https://hyperphor.com/ammdi/Call-Congress">Call Congress</a>. I am under no illusions that this accomplishes anything other than making me feel a little better. 

<h3>Details</h3>

      Each circle in the scatterplot is a county.<br/>
Size represents population; color represents degree of Republican-leaning (red) vs Democratic-leaning (blue) votes in the specified presidential election. (3rd party votes are ignored)<br/>
The x-axis of the scatterplot is the population density (people/miles<sup>2</sup>) on a log scale.<br/>
The y-axis is % of the vote that went Democratic in the given presidential election.<br/>
Try selecting a region in the scatterplot or map.
